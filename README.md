# Accessibility Improvement, Horiseon Web Services

## Description 

As our first homework assignment, we were asked to improve the accessibility of a mock website. I maed the following changes to improve accessibility for people with low vision and other disabilities: 

* Optimized SEO for better findability
* Improved color contrast
* Added alt tags so screen readers would skep the images and icons, all of which are decorative
* Added metadata to page header
* Gave page a descriptive title
* Increased font sizes
